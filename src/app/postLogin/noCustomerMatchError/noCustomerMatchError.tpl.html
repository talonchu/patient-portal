        <div>We're sorry, we do not have any clinicians that are eligible to serve you at this time. 
        This is most likely because there are no providers with a medical license where you live. 
        However, we are continually adding clinicians and hope to cover your location very soon.</div>

        <div>If you believe you are a sponsored user or that there should be clinicians eligible to serve you, 
        it is possible that we were unable to match your account with your pre-registration information. 
        Please call customer support at {{phoneNumber}} and we will attempt to resolve this issue.
