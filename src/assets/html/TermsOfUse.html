<div style="text-align: center;width: 100%"> TERMS OF USE</div>
<br/><br/>
<div style="text-align: left;width: 100%">This TERMS OF USE ("Agreement") is a legally binding agreement between you and
    Intellivisit, Inc. ("Intellivisit," "we," "us") governing your use of the services that we provide (the "Services")
    and your use of our website www.intellivisit.com (the "Website").
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;width: 100%">Intellivisit is better, faster, and cheaper than going to see the doctor.
    Intellivisit will diagnose your symptoms and help you determine the best course of action. Not only is it more
    convenient - you can see the doctor on demand at any time from a computer or mobile device - it is also more
    accurate. Intellivisit pairs an expert artificial intelligence system with certified clinicians to get the most
    accurate diagnosis and treatment plan possible.
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;width: 100%">Unlike traditional symptom checkers which feature a fixed set of questions,
    Intellivisit is an interactive experience that will tailor questions in real-time according to how you describe your
    symptoms. And unlike traditional telehealth services, you don't need to video or voice chat with a clinician - which
    means you can use Intellivisit anywhere and anytime. There's no need to find a quiet or private space just to chat
    with your doctor.
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;width: 100%">Finally, our Services get smarter with each use so you receive the best care
    possible. The more we learn about your history and preferences and coordinate with your doctors, the better our
    system is able to personalize, customize, and improve upon your experience.
</div>
<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;width: 100%">IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.
